# Class: ChemicalCompound 


_A chemical compound monitored in environmental samples. The compound list (1500+ substances) was developed in PARC WP9 in collaboration with other WPs. Each compound is identified by multiple persistent identifiers and assigned to a compound group. See: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17175075_
