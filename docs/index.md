# Metadata Schema for Data Concerning Chemicals in the Outdoor Environment

This metadata schema represents the minimum metadata community standard for reporting data concerning  the occurrence of chemicals in the outdoor environment (environmental monitoring data) as discussed and agreed upon  by the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals. The schema contains metadata elements and associated codelists to describe a project or monitoring programme that generated the data, elements to describe the monitoring site, sample,  concentration and other parameters, and the associated codelists. Atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic environments,  as well as in biota, are covered.
